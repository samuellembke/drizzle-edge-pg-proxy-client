# TODO: Enhance Client to Match Neon's Robustness

This document outlines the improvements needed to bring our `drizzle-edge-pg-proxy-client` to the same level of robustness as Neon's `@neondatabase/serverless` client.

## Error Handling Enhancements

- [x] Create a proper `PgError` class that extends `Error` with PostgreSQL-specific fields:
  - [x] Add severity levels (ERROR, FATAL, PANIC, etc.)
  - [x] Add error codes (based on PostgreSQL SQLSTATE codes)
  - [x] Add detail, hint, position fields
  - [x] Add schema, table, column references
  - [x] Add file, line, routine for debugging
- [x] Implement proper error deserialization from HTTP responses
- [ ] Add specific error types for different categories (connection, query, transaction)
- [x] Improve error messages with contextual information

## SQL Query Processing

- [x] Enhance parameter binding with full PostgreSQL type awareness
- [x] Improve SQL template composition with proper recursive handling
- [x] Implement better value serialization for complex types (arrays, JSON, etc.)
- [ ] Add validation for SQL statements
- [ ] Support named parameters in addition to positional parameters
- [x] Handle binary data encoding properly (bytea format)

## Type System Integration

- [x] Implement proper type mapping between PostgreSQL and JavaScript types
- [x] Add support for custom type parsers
- [x] Handle array types properly with element type parsing
- [x] Add proper timestamp/date handling with timezone awareness
- [x] Support for numeric types with precision
- [x] Handle JSON/JSONB types correctly

## Query Features

- [ ] Implement query cancellation mechanism
- [ ] Add support for cursor-based pagination
- [ ] Support for listening to PostgreSQL notifications
- [ ] Implement prepared statements for better performance
- [ ] Add query timeout options

## Transaction Management

- [x] Add support for different isolation levels:
  - [x] READ UNCOMMITTED
  - [x] READ COMMITTED
  - [x] REPEATABLE READ
  - [x] SERIALIZABLE
- [x] Implement read-only transaction support
- [x] Add deferrable transaction support
- [ ] Support for savepoints within transactions
- [ ] Better handling of transaction failures and retries

## Connection Management

- [ ] Implement connection pooling for better performance
- [ ] Add connection timeout and retry logic
- [ ] Support for connection health checks
- [ ] Implement connection string validation and normalization
- [ ] Add connection events (connected, disconnected, error)

## Result Handling

- [ ] Enhance result parsing for all PostgreSQL data types
- [ ] Support for array mode vs object mode in results
- [ ] Add streaming result support for large datasets
- [ ] Implement proper field metadata handling
- [ ] Better handling of empty results

## Authentication Improvements

- [ ] Support for different authentication methods
- [ ] Add token refresh functionality
- [ ] Implement function-based token providers
- [ ] Support for client certificates

## Performance Optimization

- [ ] Optimize parameter serialization
- [ ] Reduce memory usage for large results
- [ ] Add request batching for better throughput
- [ ] Implement connection reuse strategies
- [ ] Add metrics gathering for performance monitoring

## Documentation and Examples

- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Add examples for common use cases
- [ ] Document known limitations
- [ ] Create migration guides from other libraries
- [ ] Add best practices documentation

## Testing

- [ ] Implement comprehensive unit tests for all components
- [ ] Add integration tests with actual PostgreSQL
- [ ] Create stress tests for performance validation
- [ ] Add compatibility tests with different frameworks (Next.js, Auth.js, etc.)
- [ ] Test against different PostgreSQL versions

## Server-Side Improvements

- [ ] Enhance the proxy server to support all PostgreSQL features
- [ ] Add proper statement timeout handling
- [ ] Implement better logging for debugging
- [ ] Support for multiple result formats
- [ ] Add proper HTTP/2 support for better performance

## Security Enhancements

- [ ] Implement proper input validation
- [ ] Add support for SSL/TLS configuration
- [ ] Implement statement timeout to prevent DoS
- [ ] Add proper handling of sensitive information in logs
- [ ] Support for connection encryption options

## Priority Implementation Order

1. Error handling improvements
2. SQL query processing enhancements
3. Type system integration
4. Transaction management
5. Result handling improvements
6. Connection management
7. Performance optimizations
8. Authentication improvements
9. Testing
10. Documentation and examples

This implementation plan will help ensure that our client matches or exceeds the robustness of Neon's implementation while maintaining compatibility with both Drizzle ORM and Auth.js.
